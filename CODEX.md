D3M0N-AI-Realms
<!--BEGIN_DESCRIPTION-->
D3M0N-AI-Realms is a real-time, interactive, multi-modal AI framework built for creating chaotic, demon-themed experiences. Itâ€™s designed for entertainment platforms, allowing users to interact with digital personas, summon entities, and engage in real-time conversations. The framework handles speech-to-text, voice activity detection, and real-time personality generation while scaling to support thousands of concurrent sessions.
